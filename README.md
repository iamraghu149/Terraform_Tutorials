When working with Terraform, it's typical to organize your infrastructure code into separate files. Here's how you might structure your Terraform module:


# Managed Services Module Structure
managed_services/
│
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
├── security/
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── variables.tf
│
├── networking/
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── variables.tf
│
└── backups/
    ├── main.tf
    └── variables.tf



# File Descriptions:

1. main.tf:
This file contains the main configuration of your managed services, including the resources you want to provision.

2. variables.tf:
This file contains variable definitions that are used in your main configuration file (main.tf). This allows you to keep your main configuration file cleaner and more readable.

3. outputs.tf:
This file defines the output values of the resources provisioned. This is useful for sharing information between different modules or between Terraform and other tools.

4. providers.tf:
This file is used to define the providers you will be using in your module. You can specify the version and configure provider-specific settings here.

5. security/:
This directory contains configurations related to security services like Security as a Service (SECaaS), including main configurations and variables specific to security.

6. networking/:
This directory contains configurations related to networking services, including main configurations and variables specific to networking.

7. backups/:
This directory contains configurations related to backup and disaster recovery services, including main configurations and variables specific to backups.



# Example Content:

# main.tf
module "security" {
  source = "./security"
  // Input variables
}

module "networking" {
  source = "./networking"
  // Input variables
}

module "backups" {
  source = "./backups"
  // Input variables
}

// Additional resources


# variables.tf
variable "region" {
  description = "The AWS region to deploy resources."
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "The environment for the resources."
  type        = string
}

variable "project_name" {
  description = "The name of the project."
  type        = string
}

// Add more variables as needed


# outputs.tf
output "security_group_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group."
  value       = module.security.security_group_id
}

output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the VPC."
  value       = module.networking.vpc_id
}

// Add more outputs as needed


# providers.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
  // Other provider configurations
}


# security/main.tf
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  // Security group configuration
}


# security/variables.tf
variable "security_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the security group."
  type        = string
}

// Add more variables as needed


# networking/main.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  // VPC configuration
}


# networking/variables.tf
variable "vpc_cidr_block" {
  description = "The CIDR block for the VPC."
  type        = string
}

// Add more variables as needed


# backups/main.tf
resource "aws_backup_plan" "example" {
  // Backup plan configuration
}


# backups/variables.tf
variable "backup_plan_name" {
  description = "The name of the backup plan."
  type        = string
}

// Add more variables as needed

This structure keeps your codebase organized and modular, making it easier to manage and maintain, especially as your infrastructure grows.


Here's how you can structure your Managed Services Terraform module:
# Module Structure

managed_services/
│
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
└── provider.tf


# File Descriptions:
1. main.tf:
This file contains the main configuration of your managed services, including the resources you want to provision.
2. variables.tf:
This file contains variable definitions that are used in your main configuration file (main.tf). This allows you to keep your main configuration file cleaner and more readable.
3. outputs.tf:
This file defines the output values of the resources provisioned. This is useful for sharing information between different modules or between Terraform and other tools.
4. provider.tf:
This file is used to define the providers you will be using in your module. You can specify the version and configure provider-specific settings here.

# Example Content:
main.tf                ---------------------------------------||
# Declare provider
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

# Networking
module "network" {
  source = "./network"

# Security
module "security" {
  source = "./security"
  // Input variables
}

# Backup and Disaster Recovery
module "backup" {
  source = "./backup"
  // Input variables
}


variables.tf            ---------------------------------------||

variable "project_name" {
  description = "The name of the project."
  type        = string

# Add more variables as needed


outputs.tf             ---------------------------------------||
output "networking_output" {

}

output "security_output" {
  value = module.security.security_group_id
}

output "backup_output" {
  value = module.backup.backup_plan_id
}


provider.tf            ---------------------------------------||
# Declare provider
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
  // Other provider configurations
}


security/main.tf       ---------------------------------------||
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  // Security group configuration
}


security/variables.tf  ---------------------------------------||
variable "security_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the security group."
  type        = string

# Add more variables as needed


network/main.tf        ---------------------------------------||

  // VPC configuration
}


network/variables.tf   ---------------------------------------||
variable "vpc_cidr_block" {
  description = "The CIDR block for the VPC."
  type        = string
}

# Add more variables as needed


backup/main.tf         ---------------------------------------||
resource "aws_backup_plan" "example" {
  // Backup plan configuration
}


backup/variables.tf    ---------------------------------------||
variable "backup_plan_name" {
  description = "The name of the backup plan."
  type        = string

# Add more variables as needed
