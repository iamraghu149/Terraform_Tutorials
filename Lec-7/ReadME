Types of Provisioners:
1. File Provisioner
2. Local-exec Provisioner
3. Remote-exec Provisioner


Connection Block:
Most provisioners require access to the remote resource via SSH or WinRM, and expect a nested connection block with details about how to connect.

File Provisioner:
• File Provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource.
• The file provisioner supports both ssh and Winrm type of connections.


Local-exec Provisioner:
• The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created.
• This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource.


Remote-exec Provisioner:
• The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created.
• This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc.
